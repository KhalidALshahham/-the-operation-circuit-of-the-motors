here in this circuit we tried to convert 12V DC to 5V DC using many solutions 
One of the solutions is to design a circuit using regulator LM7805 +resistors+ and capacitors
as shown the pic uplouded 
the other solution is to use a ready-made module as LM2596
this kind of circuits called step down circuit
